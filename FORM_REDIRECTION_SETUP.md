✅ **Flight Search Form Redirection - Complete Setup**

## 🎯 **What Was Changed:**

### 1. **New Form → Old Working Backend**
- **Before**: New forms submitted to `{% url 'flights:new_index' %}` (new broken backend)
- **After**: New forms submit to `{% url 'app:demo' %}` (old working backend)

### 2. **Forms Updated:**
- `/flights/templates/flights/partials/flight_search_form.html` ✅
- `/flights/templates/new/index.html` ✅

### 3. **Field Name Verification:**
Both forms have the exact field names the old backend expects:
- ✅ `name="Origin"`
- ✅ `name="Destination"` 
- ✅ `name="Departuredate"`
- ✅ `name="Returndate"`

## 🚀 **Testing Plan:**

### **Test URLs:**
1. **New Form at**: `http://your-domain/flights/new/`
   - Form submits to old working backend
   - Results show in old working results page

2. **Partial Form**: Wherever the partial is included
   - Also submits to old working backend

### **Test Steps:**
1. Go to `http://your-domain/flights/new/`
2. Fill out the form:
   - Origin: `JFK` (John F. Kennedy International Airport)
   - Destination: `LAX` (Los Angeles International Airport)
   - Departure Date: Any future date
   - Return Date: Optional (for round trip)
3. Click "Search Flight"
4. **Expected Result**: Form submits to `/flight/` and shows results on `demo/results.html`

## 🔍 **Debug Information:**
When you submit the form, check server logs for:
- `=== OLD WORKING SETUP DEBUG: POST request received ===`
- `=== OLD WORKING SETUP: Form data extraction ===`
- `=== OLD WORKING SETUP: API parameters ===`
- `=== OLD WORKING SETUP: Making API call ===`

## 📋 **Current Flow:**
```
New Beautiful Form → Old Proven Backend → Old Working Results Page
    (/flights/new/)       (/flight/)           (demo/results.html)
```

## ✨ **Benefits:**
- ✅ New beautiful UI design
- ✅ Proven working Amadeus API integration
- ✅ Tested results display
- ✅ No risk of breaking existing functionality

The new forms now use the old proven backend that you know works perfectly! 🎯
