# Welcome View Fix Summary

## Issue
User authentication was successful but the welcome view was throwing a 500 error, preventing access to the dashboard.

## Root Causes Found

### 1. Typo in Welcome View (CRITICAL)
- **File**: `apps/views.py` line 390
- **Issue**: `'user': request.usper` instead of `'user': request.user`
- **Fix**: Corrected the typo to `request.user`

### 2. Conflicting Redirect Signal Handlers
- **File**: `apps/views.py` lines 152-168
- **Issue**: Custom redirect signal handlers were conflicting with login view redirects
- **Fix**: Disabled the signal handlers to prevent conflicts

### 3. Excessive Signal Logging During Login
- **File**: `apps/signals.py` lines 77-84
- **Issue**: Profile update signals were firing multiple times during login
- **Fix**: Modified signal to not log routine login-related updates

## Files Modified
- `/apps/views.py` - Fixed typo and disabled conflicting redirects
- `/apps/signals.py` - Reduced excessive logging during login

## Result
- Welcome view should now load properly after login
- User authentication and dashboard access should work correctly
- Reduced log noise during login process

## Test Steps
1. Login with existing user credentials
2. Should be redirected to welcome view without 500 error
3. Should be able to access dashboard from welcome view
