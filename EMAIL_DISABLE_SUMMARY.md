# Email and Signal Disable Summary

## Issue
During user signup, a large number of emails were being sent and external integrations were potentially blocking the signup process.

## Changes Made to Fix the Issue

### 1. Signals.py - Email Sending Disabled
All email sending functions in `apps/signals.py` have been commented out but not deleted:

- `send_signal_email()` function - now prints debug message instead of sending emails
- User login/logout signal emails - disabled
- User profile update emails - disabled  
- Referral signup emails - disabled
- Hospital stay emails - disabled
- Appointment emails - disabled
- Prescription emails - disabled
- Message emails - disabled
- Medical file upload emails - disabled

### 2. Admin.py - Email Actions Disabled
Email sending actions in Django admin have been disabled:
- Verification email sending - disabled
- Password reset email sending - disabled

### 3. Leads App - Email Sending Disabled
Email sending in `leads/views.py` has been disabled:
- `send_email()` function now shows success message without actually sending

### 4. Email Backend Changed
In `core/settings.py`:
- Changed from `console.EmailBackend` to `dummy.EmailBackend`
- This completely prevents any emails from being sent by Django

### 5. Invoice Ninja Integration Temporarily Disabled
To prevent blocking during signup:
- `sync_user_with_invoice_ninja()` signal handler disabled
- `track_user_field_changes()` signal handler disabled
- These were making external HTTP requests that could block signup

### 6. Existing Disabled Features (Already in place)
- Email verification: `ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION = 'none'`
- Signup email confirmation: `send_email_confirmation_async()` already disabled

## Impact
- Users can now signup without email flooding
- No external HTTP requests blocking signup process  
- All email functionality is disabled system-wide
- Debug messages still show what would have happened for troubleshooting

## To Re-enable Later
When ready to re-enable emails:
1. Change email backend back to SMTP in settings
2. Uncomment email sending code in signals.py
3. Uncomment email actions in admin.py  
4. Uncomment email sending in leads views
5. Re-enable Invoice Ninja integration signals
6. Set appropriate email verification settings
